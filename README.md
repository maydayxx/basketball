basketball
==========

This repository will keep the MatLab files for my basketball simulation. 

basketball.m is the Matlab file that runs the simulation
basketballAnimate.m is the Matlab file that runs the simulation and also plots the position of the basketball
basketballSimulation.m is the Matlab file that runs the simulation over a loop of all the initial conditions to determine which initial conditions are most successful
